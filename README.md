# Sanjeev Reddy Lab X: Reverb Spatializer

## Overview
In my LabX, I created a real-time spatializer that applies a Schroeder reverb
to a source being played at any given point within a 30m x 20m room (using hops
of 0.5m between points).

In order to avoid massive latencies, I had to pre-calculate the reverbs generated
by this sample from every reachable point in the room. These pre-determined
reverbed samples are generated by `makereverb.py` and stored in `reverbs.pkl`.
The reverb was applied using a Schroeder model, and was calculated assuming that
the listener and sound source were both at the same coordinate in the room.

Real-time listener/source locations are determined by using the sliders in the
graph interface. These locations are read each time an output block is written
to the stream, and are used to determine which pre-rendered reverb sample should
be used for that position in the room.

## Running the Spatializer

**DEPENDENCIES USED**
* pyaudio
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* wave
* pickle
* threading

To run the spatializer: `python3 realtime.py`

Listener/source position can be adjusted with the sliders. The sample can be
replayed using the "Replay" button.

**NOTE:** Due to the large size of `reverbs.pkl`, the GUI will take a few seconds
to appear as the reverbed sounds load.

**Song Snippet Used:** Foals - Balloons
